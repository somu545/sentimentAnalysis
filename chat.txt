19/09/23, 18:36 - +91 98844 84324: Find the minimum cost for hiring developers:- There are (n+m) developers(all the developers can work on both frontend and backend). Two arrays are given in which the first array consists cost of frontend developers and the second array consists cost of Backend developers. We have to pick 'n' frontend-developer from the first array and 'm' backend developers from the second array such that we have to minimize the total cost of hiring n+m developers, also if we pick a frontend-developer from the first array then we cannot pick a backend-developer from the second array with the same index.
19/09/23, 18:41 - +91 74986 18461: Is it on leetcode or any other platform??

19/09/23, 20:00 - +91 92160 17500: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 20:22 - +91 91300 57189: To find the minimum cost for hiring n frontend developers and m backend developers from two arrays of costs (one for frontend, one for backend), follow these steps:

1. Sort both cost arrays in ascending order.

2. Start with an initial minimum cost of infinity.

3. Try different combinations of selecting ```n``` developers from the frontend array and ```m``` developers from the backend array while keeping the total count not exceeding ```n + m```.

4. Calculate the total cost for each combination.

5. If you find a combination with a lower total cost, update the minimum cost.

6. Keep track of the selected developers' indices for the combination with the lowest cost.

7. Once you've tried all possible combinations, you'll have the minimum cost and the selected developers.

Psudo code :

```def minCostOfDevelopers(frontend_costs, backend_costs, n, m):
    frontend_costs.sort()
    backend_costs.sort()
    minCost = float('inf')
    selectedDevelopers = []

    for i in range(n + 1):
        for j in range(m + 1):
            if i + j > n + m:
                continue

            totalCost = sum(frontend_costs[:i]) + sum(backend_costs[:j])

            if totalCost < minCost:
                minCost = totalCost
                selectedDevelopers = list(range(i)) + list(range(n, n + j))

    return minCost, selectedDevelopers
```
19/09/23, 20:26 - +91 92160 17500: Why answer is A? Can 0 be a Huffman code ever?
19/09/23, 23:13 - +91 98844 84324: Since this is a brute force approach, how can we come up with a optimised solution?
19/09/23, 23:47 - +91 90273 36125: Anyone enrolled algoprep course?
20/09/23, 07:53 - +91 91300 57189: right;

the previous approach is a brute force solution with a time complexity of ```O((n+m)^2)``` due to the nested loops.

 You can optimize this problem using dynamic programming. Here's an optimized approach:

1. Create two arrays: one for the cost of frontend developers and another for the cost of backend developers.

2. Create a 2D array ```dp``` of size ```(n+1) x (m+1)``` to store the minimum cost for hiring ```i``` frontend developers and ```j``` backend developers.

3. Initialize ```dp[i][j]``` to infinity for all values of ```i``` and ```j```, except ```dp[0][0]``` which is initialized to 0.

4. Iterate through ```i``` from 0 to ```n``` and ```j``` from 0 to ```m```:

   a. For each ```dp[i][j]```, calculate the cost of hiring ```i``` frontend developers from the first array and ```j``` backend developers from the second array.
   
   b. Update ```dp[i][j]``` as the minimum of:
      - ```dp[i-1][j] + frontend_costs[i-1]``` if you hire a frontend developer from the first array.
      - ```dp[i][j-1] + backend_costs[j-1]``` if you hire a backend developer from the second array.

5. The value in ```dp[n][m]``` will represent the minimum cost of hiring ```n``` frontend developers and ```m``` backend developers.

6. To find which developers were hired, you can backtrack through the ```dp``` array starting from `dp[n][m]` and check whether you arrived at that cell from ```dp[i-1][j]``` (frontend) or ```dp[i][j-1]``` (backend).

Pseudo code :

```
def minCostOfDevelopers(frontend_costs, backend_costs, n, m):
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0

    for i in range(n + 1):
        for j in range(m + 1):
            if i > 0:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j] + frontend_costs[i - 1])
            if j > 0:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][j - 1] + backend_costs[j - 1])

    minCost = dp[n][m]

    # Backtrack to find the selected developers
    selectedDevelopers = []
    i, j = n, m
    while i > 0 or j > 0:
        if i > 0 and dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j] + frontend_costs[i - 1]:
            selectedDevelopers.append(f"Frontend {i - 1}")
            i -= 1
        else:
            selectedDevelopers.append(f"Backend {j - 1}")
            j -= 1

    selectedDevelopers.reverse()
    return minCost, selectedDevelopers
```

This optimized approach has a time complexity of ```O(n*m)```, making it much more efficient than the brute force solution for larger inputs.
20/09/23, 08:52 - +91 98844 84324: Shouldn't we also ensure that the indexes of frontend and backend developers don't match?
20/09/23, 08:53 - +91 98844 84324: Like using an ordered set?
20/09/23, 09:00 - +91 86683 52166: Chatgpt solution, but we can't modify the indexes....one shouldn't trust chatgpt when it comes to ds algo
20/09/23, 09:07 - +91 86683 52166: Usually while doing DS algo problems we need to ensure that we don't modify the data like sorting and other....I mean do it, but only whenever it is necessary.....
Like if a problem is solvable without sorting with the same space and time complexities avoid sorting
Avoid modifying the data given 
For eg, when reversing a linked list there are two approaches, one is to modify the data stored and other is to modify the links, we all know widely accepted solution is to modify the links, not the data, why so?? Because companies prefer we don't modify the data, this is not mandatory but are considered good software engineering practicesüëçüèª <This message was edited>

22/09/23, 12:39 - +91 76939 28591: Hello Friends,
I am a beginner and currently going into frontend development. There's a famous teacher "Sanket Singh". He works at Google and he is launching a frontend development course on 30 September. I wanted to buy that course because that teacher is very good. My friends have studied backend from him and I got really good reviews about his course. The frontend course costs Rs 5000. I am thinking to buy the course by sharing. We can share the amount among 2-3 people and we can do the course together. In this way, we will be able to learn from a good teacher at a minimal price. If anyone is interested in buying this course (sharing), they can DM me.

You can see the course details from the below video link. It's really a very comprehensive course. It also includes major projects and capstone projects.

I don't like doing this. But I'm from a humble background and it's difficult for me to pay a big amount.

Just make sure you know the basics, and have strong grasp over concepts.

I'm solving problems from Parikh Jain's roadmap and neetcode.io and understand concepts from Kunal kushwaha.
I have issues with being consistent.
Sometimes, a problem would annoy me so much, phirse baithneka man udta hai.
24/09/23, 17:59 - +91 97139 57553: I haven't explored Parikh Jain's roadmap. I follow Love Babbar's DSA course and Striver's a to z. 
Maybe you can try any of these if you aren't liking Parikh Jain's. Love Babbar's is easier to understand (for me) but Striver's is more interview oriented. That's why following both

I am in final year too.
24/09/23, 18:00 - +91 98330 91252: Parikh Jain has a well maintained Roadmap in a Spreadsheet which I liked.

24/09/23, 18:08 - +91 98330 91252: How do you stay consistent?
That's my biggest problem :‚Å†-‚Å†(
24/09/23, 18:11 - +91 97139 57553: Self discipline. I could be the most inconsistent person you know. I tried and have failed multiple times in doing DSA daily. But I kept going. And I challenged myself to maintain DSA streak. 

I used to watch people on LinkedIn posting their Leetcode streak and it used to hurt. So I decided to not give up DSA even for a day, not even in college exams, not in sickness in nothing and maintain a streak not to show off but for myself. I write the day and date whenever I solve questions. 
It's been 188 days so far ‚ú®
24/09/23, 18:11 - +91 97139 57553: The only key is to not give up
